Project structure template for developing machine learning models as packages.



## How to get started?
[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) is used to generate the PyTorch model package template. So first install cookiecutter with pip:

``` bash
pip install cookiecutter
```
Generate the template:
``` bash
python -m cookiecutter https://github.com/KasperJuunge/pytorch-package-template
```

## Workflow

When the template is initialized it creates a project structure that is ready for developing your very own PyTorch model ðŸ”¥

My typical workflow using this project structure is the following:

#### 1. Get Raw Data

First, get the data. Write the get_model_data() function to get the raw data for modeling. Place the raw data in ~/data_storage/raw/

#### 2. Data Exploration

Now we need to get our hands dirty! Explore the data, analyze the problem, make some plots, remove outliers and try to come up with some input features. This process is carried out using Jupyter Notebooks which should be placed in ~/notebooks/

#### 3. Build Features

When the data exploration phase is done, write the build_features() function that turns the raw data into juicy features. The function should also split the dataset in train, validation and test set and place it in ~/data_storage/dataset/

#### 4. Train Model

Now we're ready to train the model. In this phase ...
